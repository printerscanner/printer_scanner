              <p>We rarely think of the website as an artistic medium, even less as the most dominant artistic medium of the 21st Century, used like the Medici's to gain and enforce power. As objects, websites face obsolescence almost immediately, sometimes even before their completion. They are unstable and degrade over time. A website can be deleted accidentally, its electrons rearranged into junk in an instant.</p>
      
              <p>Physical ephemera is by contrast much more long lasting. We will hold on to a scrap of paper with a drawing from our loved ones our whole lives. Even with delicate artifacts like paper, our instinct for preservation has allowed our species us to reach back thousands of years.</p>
      
              <p>Printing remains an expensive, inaccessible medium. Words that are printed and disseminated are still allowed only to the celebrities of the world (Prince Harry). It's hard today to even print anything! Do you have a working printer in your house? I didn't think so.</p>
